# Creating Instagram Graphics: Canva vs. Python Script

You have two main options for creating Instagram thumbnails. Here's when to use each:

---

## Option 1: Python Script (Automated)

### ✅ Best For:
- Quick thumbnails for blog posts

- Batch generating many images at once
- Simple text-on-background designs
- When you want automation

### How to Use:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python generate_thumbnails.py --post pattern-of-corruption
```

### Pros:
- ✅ Free
- ✅ Fast (seconds per image)
- ✅ Consistent design
- ✅ No design skills needed
- ✅ Batch processing

### Cons:
- ❌ Limited design flexibility
- ❌ Text-only (no photos/illustrations)

---

## Option 2: Canva (Manual Design)

### ✅ Best For:
- Infographics with data visualization
- Multi-slide carousels
- Images with photos/illustrations

- When you want fine control

### How to Use:
1. Go to canva.com
2. Create free account
3. Search "Instagram Post" template
4. Customize with your content
5. Download and share

### Pros:

## Recommended Workflow: Use Both!

### Daily Quote Graphics → Python Script
For your daily post featuring a blog post title:
```bash
python generate_thumbnails.py --post todays-post
```
Fast, consistent, perfect for text-based quotes.

### Weekly Infographics → Canva
For data visualizations, carousels, and special graphics:
- Use Canva's templates
- Add charts, graphs, illustrations
- More engaging for complex information

### Example Schedule:

**Monday-Friday:** Python-generated quote graphics

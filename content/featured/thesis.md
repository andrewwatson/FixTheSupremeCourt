# A Stolen Court: How the Supreme Court Lost Its Legitimacy and Why Reform Is Overdue

The United States Supreme Court is supposed to be above politics. It's supposed to represent the rule of law, not the rule of party. But here's a fact that should make every American's blood boil: six of the nine current justices were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, and three were confirmed by senators representing less than half the American population.

This isn't your parents' Supreme Court. This is a partisan institution that has been systematically captured through decades of political maneuvering, outright hypocrisy, and constitutional hardball. The result? A Court that doesn't represent America is now making decisions that will govern America for generations.

## The Path Forward: Reform or Irrelevance

The status quo is unsustainable. A Supreme Court that operates without accountability, represents a minority of Americans, and makes decisions based on partisan politics rather than legal principle cannot maintain legitimacy in a democracy.

Reform isn't radicalâ€”it's essential. Whether that means expanding the Court, implementing term limits, establishing binding ethics rules, or requiring supermajority votes to overturn precedent, something must change.

The alternative is a democracy where unelected, unaccountable lifetime appointees can override the will of the people indefinitely. That's not the American system our founders envisioned, and it's not the system we should accept.

The Supreme Court belongs to the American people, not to the Federalist Society, not to dark money donors, and not to the political party that happened to be in power when vacancies occurred. It's time to fix the Court before the Court breaks our democracy entirely.

The choice is clear: reform the Court, or watch it continue to undermine the very democratic principles it's supposed to protect. The American people deserve better than a stolen Court making decisions that will govern our lives for decades to come.

It's time to fix the Supreme Court.

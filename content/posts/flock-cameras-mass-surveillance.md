## The Surveillance Network You Never Voted For

There's a good chance you've driven past one without knowing it. Mounted on poles at intersections and highway on-ramps across thousands of American cities, Flock Safety cameras look like ordinary traffic devices—boxy white units perched at the edges of streets, easy to miss.

They are not ordinary. They are automated license plate readers (ALPRs) that photograph every passing vehicle, capture make, model, color, and plate number, and upload that data to a cloud database accessible by law enforcement agencies across the country.

Flock Safety now operates cameras in [more than 5,000 cities and towns across all 50 states](https://www.flocksafety.com/). Tens of millions of Americans have their daily movements logged, stored, and shared—with no warrant, no probable cause, and no meaningful oversight—every time they drive.

And increasingly, that data is flowing directly to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

## What Flock Cameras Actually Do

Flock Safety markets its product to local police departments and homeowners associations as a crime-fighting tool. The pitch is simple: put cameras at neighborhood entry points, capture every vehicle, and you'll be able to solve car thefts and burglaries after the fact.

What the marketing materials don't emphasize:

**Every vehicle is logged, not just suspects.** Flock cameras photograph and record every car that passes, not just vehicles matching a description or alert. Law-abiding residents who have never committed any crime have their movements permanently recorded.

**Data is shared across jurisdictions.** Through Flock's "TALON" network, police departments share data with each other. A camera in one town can generate leads for departments in other cities, states—or federal agencies.

**Retention extends well beyond immediate investigations.** Flock retains data for 30 days by default, but many agencies can request extended retention. A month of your daily commute, doctor's appointments, church attendance, and political activities sits in a private company's database, accessible to thousands of law enforcement agencies.

**The cameras do more than read plates.** [Flock cameras use AI to capture vehicle attributes](https://www.flocksafety.com/products/falcon) including bumper stickers, roof racks, and other distinguishing features. The company has also added capabilities to detect the ethnicity of vehicle occupants—a feature civil liberties groups have flagged as deeply problematic.

## The ICE Connection

The surveillance network Flock has built across American communities was originally sold to local governments as a neighborhood crime tool. It has become a key piece of immigration enforcement infrastructure.

[Documented ICE use of ALPR data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/03/automatic-license-plate-readers-are-mass-surveillance-infrastructure-why-we-need) through networks like Flock and its competitor Vigilant Solutions has allowed federal immigration agents to track vehicles associated with undocumented immigrants, identify patterns of movement, and conduct surveillance without ever approaching a judge for a warrant.

This creates a constitutional crisis hiding in plain sight.

When a local town in Ohio or Tennessee installs Flock cameras to catch car thieves, that town's residents did not vote to participate in federal immigration enforcement. Local officials often have no idea that the data-sharing agreements they signed give federal agencies access to their residents' movements. And in many cities that have declared themselves "sanctuary cities" specifically to limit local police cooperation with ICE, Flock's data-sharing arrangements may be routing information around those protections entirely.

[The Electronic Frontier Foundation documented how ICE has used ALPR data](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2023/04/ice-uses-driver-location-data-deportations) to track and arrest immigrants across the country, often in communities whose local governments had explicitly tried to limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.

The surveillance is happening without a warrant, without local democratic authorization, and often without the knowledge of the communities being surveilled.

## Fighting Back: Why Americans Are Dismantling Flock Cameras

In a remarkable grassroots response to the spread of Flock cameras, [Americans across the country have begun physically removing or disabling the devices](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/across-the-us-people-are-dismantling).

The dismantling has happened in cities large and small. People have knocked cameras off poles, covered lenses with spray paint, and in some cases pulled the devices down entirely. The actions are almost certainly illegal under vandalism statutes—and they represent a form of political protest that's unusual in the tech-surveillance age.

What drives people to take physical action against surveillance infrastructure?

The answer, in many cases, is a sense that democratic processes have failed. When residents learn that their movements have been logged without their consent, when they discover that data they never agreed to share is being used for federal immigration enforcement, when they realize that their "sanctuary city" protections have been routed around by a private company's data-sharing contracts—some people conclude that legal channels are too slow, too uncertain, and too captured by the same interests that built the surveillance network.

This doesn't mean vandalism is the right answer. It means people feel they have no other options.

That feeling is a political failure of the first order.

## The Fourth Amendment Problem

The legal foundation for ALPR surveillance rests on an increasingly shaky doctrine: the "third-party doctrine," which holds that information you voluntarily share with third parties has no Fourth Amendment protection.

The Supreme Court partially undermined this doctrine in [*Carpenter v. United States* (2018)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/17pdf/16-402_new_cap.pdf), holding that police need a warrant to obtain historical cell-site location data. Chief Justice Roberts' majority opinion recognized that the comprehensive, automated collection of location data is qualitatively different from the traditional "third-party" sharing the doctrine was designed to address.

*Carpenter* was a significant step. It was not a complete answer.

The ruling was deliberately narrow. Roberts explicitly declined to address GPS tracking, license plate readers, and other forms of automated surveillance. Lower courts have split on whether *Carpenter* extends to ALPR data. The legal landscape is murky, inconsistent, and changing—exactly the kind of constitutional uncertainty that allows surveillance to expand while the law catches up.

A functioning Supreme Court would treat this as urgent. A mass surveillance infrastructure—one that logs the movements of tens of millions of Americans, shares data across jurisdictions without warrants, and is increasingly integrated into federal immigration enforcement—demands clear constitutional rules.

Instead, we have a Court that:

- Has been slow to schedule relevant cases
- Produced a narrowly cabined *Carpenter* ruling that left most ALPR surveillance unaddressed
- Has shown more interest in expanding police power than limiting surveillance overreach
- Is staffed with justices who were placed there by the same political movement that is most enthusiastic about surveillance expansion

## How the Supreme Court Failures Connect

The Flock camera crisis is not separate from the broader Supreme Court crisis. They are the same problem, viewed from different angles.

**The third-party doctrine** that enables warrantless ALPR surveillance was developed by a Court that couldn't anticipate ubiquitous digital surveillance. A reformed Court would update doctrine to protect against technologies the Founders couldn't have imagined—as *Carpenter* began to do, but didn't finish.

**Presidential immunity and executive overreach** created the legal and political environment in which ICE can access local surveillance networks without democratic oversight or judicial approval. When presidents can direct federal agencies to conduct mass surveillance with no accountability, Flock's data-sharing agreements become a pipeline for unchecked executive power.

**The Chevron doctrine's collapse** matters here too. When the Supreme Court overturned *Chevron* in *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo* (2024), it stripped federal agencies of deference on technical matters—but it also scrambled the regulatory framework that might otherwise have allowed the FTC or FCC to regulate data brokers and surveillance companies. The very "deregulatory" movement the Court has championed is the same movement that prevents meaningful oversight of Flock Safety's data-sharing practices.

**Voting rights destruction** has made it harder for communities to elect officials who will resist surveillance infrastructure. When voters in communities of color are systematically disenfranchised, the populations most affected by ALPR-assisted immigration enforcement have the least political power to stop it.

The surveillance state and the captured Court are products of the same political project: concentrating power in the hands of federal executive agencies, insulated from democratic accountability, unchecked by an independent judiciary.

## What a Functioning Legal System Would Look Like

Here's what shouldn't be controversial:

**Warrants should be required before accessing location data.** *Carpenter* established this for cell-site records. It should apply equally to comprehensive ALPR data. If ICE wants to track a specific suspect's movements through Flock's network, get a warrant.

**Data-sharing agreements should be transparent and limited.** Local governments should know exactly who has access to data their cameras collect. Contracts with surveillance companies should explicitly prohibit federal law enforcement access without a warrant, or should require disclosure to the local government.

**Retention limits should be enforced.** Thirty days of everyone's movements is already a substantial surveillance database. There's no public-safety justification for indefinite retention of the movements of law-abiding people.

**Sanctuary city protections should cover data.** If a city has declared it won't direct local police resources toward federal immigration enforcement, that policy should extend to data collected by local cameras. The surveillance workaround is an end-run around democratic decisions.

**Companies building surveillance infrastructure should face meaningful regulation.** Flock Safety operates one of the largest surveillance networks in American history with minimal federal oversight. That's not a feature of a well-functioning democracy.

None of these reforms require abolishing ALPRs or preventing legitimate crime investigation. They require that surveillance be governed by the same constitutional rules that apply to other police investigations.

## The Bigger Picture: Privatized Surveillance and Democratic Erosion

Flock Safety represents a new model of surveillance infrastructure: private companies build the network, sell it to local governments as a crime-fighting tool, and then share data broadly with any law enforcement agency that pays for access.

This model deliberately routes around democratic accountability. When ICE accesses a private database rather than directly directing local police, the sanctuary city's formal limits on police cooperation don't apply. When a private company sets data-sharing terms rather than local voters, residents have no direct recourse.

It's surveillance by contract, not surveillance by law. And the contracts are written by a company whose business model depends on maximizing law enforcement access.

This is the privatization of state power operating in the shadows of democratic governance. The same phenomenon appears across the modern surveillance ecosystem: facial recognition companies selling to police departments without legislative authorization, data brokers selling location data to federal agencies without warrants, immigration enforcement using commercial databases to identify and track undocumented people without going through local law enforcement.

The Supreme Court is not equipped to address this. Not because the Fourth Amendment is inadequate—it isn't—but because a Court that has been systematically packed with justices hostile to civil liberties, sympathetic to executive power, and captured by the same legal movement that built this surveillance ecosystem is not going to suddenly become a champion of privacy rights.

## The Growing Resistance

People dismantling Flock cameras are not technophobes or criminals. They are, in many cases, people who have exhausted legal channels and concluded that direct action is the only tool they have left.

This is dangerous—not because the cameras don't deserve to be challenged, but because a democracy that drives people to vandalism as a political tool has failed to provide adequate legitimate channels for democratic participation.

When people in New York, California, and Massachusetts discover that their "progressive" local governments have signed data-sharing contracts that route their personal movements to ICE, and when they discover that their elected officials didn't know what they signed, and when they discover that the legal system provides no immediate remedy—they face a choice between accepting surveillance they explicitly voted against or taking extralegal action.

The answer to that situation is not to prosecute camera-dismantlers while leaving the surveillance infrastructure intact. The answer is to build a democratic system in which people have real power over the surveillance they are subjected to.

That requires:
- Local democratic processes that actually govern surveillance contracts
- A legal system that provides timely remedies for Fourth Amendment violations
- A Supreme Court that treats mass surveillance as the constitutional crisis it is
- Congressional legislation that sets baseline privacy protections for all Americans

Until those things exist, people will keep taking cameras down with their own hands. That's not a solution. It's a symptom.

## Conclusion: Surveillance, Democracy, and the Courts

Flock cameras are not going away. The surveillance network they represent will only grow—more cameras, more data, more integration with federal enforcement agencies, more AI-powered capabilities that extract information their operators haven't fully disclosed.

The question is whether Americans will have any democratic or legal control over how that surveillance is conducted.

Right now, the answer is mostly no. Private companies write the contracts. Federal agencies access the data. Local governments sign agreements they don't fully understand. The Supreme Court has partially addressed but never resolved the constitutional questions. Congress has not passed comprehensive privacy legislation.

And communities—disproportionately immigrant communities, communities of color, and communities that voted explicitly to limit federal immigration enforcement—are being surveilled without their consent, tracked without warrants, and increasingly delivered to ICE through a network of cameras their local governments paid for.

The people dismantling those cameras aren't wrong about what the cameras represent. They're right that surveillance without accountability is an instrument of control, not public safety. They're right that democratic protections mean nothing if they can be routed around by private contracts.

They're trying to solve a problem that courts, legislatures, and democratic processes have failed to address.

Until we fix those institutions—until we have a Supreme Court that treats Fourth Amendment rights seriously, a Congress that passes real privacy legislation, and local democratic processes that actually govern surveillance technology—the cameras will keep going up, and some people will keep taking them down.

We deserve better than that choice.

## Democracy Dies in the Shadows

The Supreme Court's "shadow docket"—emergency orders issued without full briefing, oral argument, or signed opinions—has become a weapon for dismantling rights and enabling executive overreach.

Between 2017-2021, the Trump administration filed emergency applications at unprecedented rates, and the conservative majority granted them with alarming frequency.

The same justices who rushed to grant Trump emergency relief on the shadow docket later granted him sweeping immunity from criminal prosecution in *Trump v. United States*.

The pattern is clear: the Court uses emergency procedures to avoid scrutiny while expanding presidential power and shrinking individual rights. This isn't judicial restraint—it's autocracy by emergency order.

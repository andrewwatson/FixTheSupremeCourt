## Court Expansion: Actually Normal in American History

Whenever reform is discussed, critics cry that changing the Court would be "radical" or "unprecedented." This is historically illiterate nonsense.

The Supreme Court's size has changed seven times in the nation's first 80 years. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created a six-member Court. It grew to seven members in 1807, nine in 1837, ten in 1863, back to seven in 1866, and finally to nine in 1869. For most of American history, the Court's size tracked with the number of federal circuit courts.

The most famous expansion effort came in 1937, when Franklin Roosevelt threatened to add justices to overcome the Court's resistance to New Deal programs. FDR never got his expansion, but the threat workedâ€”the Court suddenly started upholding his legislation in what became known as "the switch in time that saved nine."

The idea that nine is somehow sacred is a modern myth. What's actually radical is allowing a minority-appointed Court to govern against the will of the majority indefinitely.

Other democracies regularly reform their high courts. Germany restructured its Constitutional Court after World War II. The United Kingdom replaced the House of Lords' judicial function with a new Supreme Court in 2009. Canada's Supreme Court operates with mandatory retirement ages. The idea that America's system is perfect and unchangeable is American exceptionalism at its worst.

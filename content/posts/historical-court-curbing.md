## Court Reform Is American Tradition

Throughout American history, when the Supreme Court has overreached, threatened democracy, or blocked necessary reforms, presidents and Congress have acted to check judicial power.

**Thomas Jefferson** led the impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase and refused to enforce certain court orders.

**Abraham Lincoln** defied the *Dred Scott* decision and appointed five new justices to ensure the Court would uphold Civil War measures.

**Franklin Roosevelt** threatened court-packing in 1937, forcing the Court to reverse course and uphold New Deal legislation.

Court reform isn't radical—it's how American democracy has always responded to judicial extremism. The current crisis demands the same courage our predecessors showed.

The question isn't whether we can reform the Court. It's whether we have the political will to do what Jefferson, Lincoln, and FDR did: protect democracy from judicial oligarchy.

## The Court's Religion Problem

The Supreme Court's conservative majority has systematically expanded religious liberty for Christians while diminishing everyone else's rights.

*303 Creative* (2023): Businesses can refuse service to LGBTQ customers based on religious beliefs.

*Kennedy v. Bremerton* (2022): Public school coaches can lead prayer at school events.

*Hobby Lobby* (2014): Corporations have religious freedom to deny contraception coverage.

The pattern reveals the Court's true agenda: privileging conservative Christian beliefs over secular governance, LGBTQ rights, women's autonomy, and religious pluralism.

This isn't religious freedom—it's religious favoritism. And it's accelerating under the current Court's 6-3 supermajority.

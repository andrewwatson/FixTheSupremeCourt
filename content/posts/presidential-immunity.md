## "With Fear for Our Democracy, I Dissent"

On July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court handed down one of the most dangerous decisions in American history. In *Trump v. United States*, the Court's conservative supermajority ruled that presidents have absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for their "official acts"—essentially placing them above the law.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, reading her dissent from the bench in a rare show of protest, delivered a chilling warning: ["In every use of official power, the President is now a king above the law."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2024/07/01/sotomayor-jackson-trump-immunity-dissent/)

She concluded with words that should terrify every American: ["With fear for our democracy, I dissent."](https://msmagazine.com/2024/07/01/sonia-sotomayor-dissent-trump-immunity/)

This wasn't hyperbole. The Court created a framework of presidential immunity that has no basis in the Constitution, no support in historical practice, and devastating consequences for democratic accountability.

For the first time in American history, presidents can commit crimes using the powers of their office and face no criminal consequences.

## What the Court Actually Did

The case arose from federal charges against Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, including his actions leading up to the January 6 insurrection. Trump claimed absolute immunity from prosecution for everything he did as president.

[Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the 6-3 majority](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf), created a three-tiered framework for presidential immunity that had never existed before:

### 1. Absolute Immunity for "Core Constitutional Powers"

Presidents have [absolute immunity—meaning they can never be prosecuted—for acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States) involving their "core constitutional powers." This includes issuing pardons, vetoing legislation, recognizing ambassadors, making appointments, and commanding the military.

The Court ruled that Trump's discussions with the Acting Attorney General about using the Justice Department to overturn the election fell within this absolute immunity because they involved "exclusive constitutional authority" over the executive branch.

### 2. Presumptive Immunity for Other "Official Acts"

For other actions within the "outer perimeter" of presidential responsibility, presidents enjoy ["presumptive immunity"](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/key-facts-from-the-supreme-courts-immunity-ruling-and-how-it-affects-presidential-power)—meaning prosecutors must prove that charging them wouldn't "threaten the power and function of the executive branch."

This presumption is nearly impossible to overcome because it requires proving that holding a president accountable wouldn't affect presidential power—a Catch-22.

### 3. No Immunity for "Unofficial Acts"

Only for purely private conduct—acts that have nothing to do with the presidency—is there no immunity. But the Court made it extremely difficult to determine what counts as "unofficial."

The Court sent the case back to the trial court to sort through which of Trump's alleged crimes were "official" versus "unofficial"—[effectively delaying any trial until after the 2024 election](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/supreme-courts-immunity-ruling-will-delay-trumps-jan-6-case-election-rcna159764). After Trump won that election, [the case was dismissed](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-rules-trump-absolute-immunity-criminal-prosecution/story?id=109803999).

## What This Means in Practice

The majority's decision creates a framework where presidents can commit crimes with impunity as long as they use the powers of their office to do it.

Sotomayor's dissent spelled out the horrifying implications:

["Let the President violate the law, let him exploit the trappings of his office for personal gain, let him use his official power for evil ends."](https://newrepublic.com/post/183324/sotomayor-dissent-supreme-court-trump-immunity-case)

She wasn't being dramatic. Under this ruling:

**A president could order the military to assassinate a political rival**—and claim absolute immunity because commanding the military is a core constitutional power.

**A president could order the Justice Department to prosecute enemies**—and claim absolute immunity because controlling the executive branch is within exclusive presidential authority.

**A president could accept bribes in exchange for pardons**—and claim absolute immunity because the pardon power is a core constitutional function.

**A president could use the CIA to conduct illegal surveillance on Americans**—and claim immunity because directing intelligence agencies is an official act.

**A president could sell nuclear secrets to foreign powers**—and potentially claim immunity if done through "official" channels.

These aren't hypotheticals invented by critics. [The ACLU noted](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/supreme-court-grants-trump-broad-immunity-for-official-acts-placing-presidents-above-the-law) that the decision "places presidents above the law" in ways that fundamentally undermine democratic accountability.

## No Historical Basis

Sotomayor's dissent emphasized a crucial point: ["Never in the history of our Republic has a President had reason to believe that he would be immune from criminal prosecution if he used the trappings of his office to violate the criminal law."](https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4749875-sotomayor-immunity-decision-dissent/)

The Founders didn't create presidential immunity. They created impeachment precisely because they believed presidents could be held accountable for crimes. The Constitution says no one is above the law—not even presidents.

For 235 years, presidents understood they could face criminal prosecution after leaving office. Richard Nixon accepted a pardon from Gerald Ford specifically because he knew he could be prosecuted. That understanding deterred presidential lawbreaking.

The Roberts Court invented a sweeping immunity doctrine out of thin air, with no constitutional text, no founding-era support, and no historical practice to justify it.

As [Boston University Law Professor Jed Shugerman called it](https://www.bu.edu/articles/2024/supreme-court-grants-trump-broad-immunity-from-prosecution/), this decision is a "constitutional embarrassment."

---

## The Catch-22: Evidence of Crimes Can't Be Used

The decision gets even worse. The Court ruled that prosecutors cannot introduce evidence of a president's "official acts" even to prove crimes involving unofficial conduct.

This means even if prosecutors can show a president committed a crime in their private capacity, they can't use evidence of related official actions to prove it. The wall between official and unofficial conduct creates an evidentiary black hole.

A president could take a bribe (unofficial) in exchange for an official pardon (official), and prosecutors couldn't use evidence of the pardon to prove the bribery scheme. The official act becomes a shield for the unofficial crime.

This isn't a legal framework—it's a get-out-of-jail-free card.

---

## Making a Mockery of "No One Is Above the Law"

Sotomayor's dissent cut to the heart of the matter:

["The decision makes a mockery of the principle, foundational to our Constitution and system of Government, that no man is above the law."](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/liberal-justices-say-trump-immunity-decision-will-disastrous-consequen-rcna159755)

The conservative majority responded to these concerns with bland assurances that presidents won't abuse their power because they face political accountability through impeachment and elections.

This is absurd on its face. Impeachment requires a two-thirds Senate vote—a political impossibility in our polarized era. And elections can't hold someone accountable after they've left office and committed crimes.

The majority essentially said: "Trust us, presidents won't become tyrants just because we made them immune from prosecution for using their official powers to commit crimes."

That's not a legal argument. It's wishful thinking.

---

## The Real Purpose: Protecting Trump

[The decision accomplished exactly what it was designed to do](https://constitutioncenter.org/blog/breaking-down-the-trump-immunity-decision): delay Trump's January 6 prosecution until after the 2024 election.

By sending the case back to the trial court to sort through which of Trump's actions were "official" versus "unofficial," the Court guaranteed there would be no trial before voters went to the polls.

After Trump won the 2024 election, the case was dismissed. The Court's delay tactic worked perfectly.

The conservative justices didn't just rule on an abstract legal question. They intervened to protect a specific defendant—Donald Trump—from facing trial for attempting to overturn an election.

This wasn't impartial judging. It was a rescue operation.

---

## The Dissents' Warnings

Justice Sotomayor wasn't alone in her alarm. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote separately to emphasize the dangers.

[All three liberal justices warned](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/liberal-justices-say-trump-immunity-decision-will-disastrous-consequen-rcna159755) that the ruling "will have disastrous consequences for the Presidency and for our democracy."

These warnings aren't partisan talking points. They're sober assessments from jurists who understand that making presidents immune from criminal prosecution invites authoritarian abuse.

When the Supreme Court tells presidents they can commit crimes using official power without facing prosecution, some future president will take them up on that offer.

---

## What This Means for Reform

*Trump v. United States* is exhibit B (after *Loper Bright*) for why the Supreme Court desperately needs reform.

Six unelected justices, appointed through a process that violated democratic norms, rewrote constitutional law to:
- Place presidents above criminal law
- Create immunity with no constitutional basis
- Invent evidentiary rules that shield presidential crimes
- Delay prosecution of a former president to help him politically

The decision:
- Undermines the rule of law
- Creates a framework for presidential tyranny
- Invites future abuse of power
- Makes impeachment the only accountability mechanism (which is political, not legal)
- Contradicts 235 years of constitutional understanding

And there's nothing Congress or voters can do to reverse it—unless we reform the Court itself.

This is why Court expansion, term limits, jurisdiction stripping, or other structural reforms aren't just policy preferences. They're democratic necessities.

When the Supreme Court grants presidents king-like immunity from criminal prosecution, the Court has too much power and is using it to undermine democracy itself.

---

## Conclusion: A Court Unbound, A President Unleashed

Justice Sotomayor ended her dissent with a warning that will echo through history:

["With fear for our democracy, I dissent."](https://msmagazine.com/2024/07/01/sonia-sotomayor-dissent-trump-immunity/)

She was right to be afraid. The Supreme Court didn't just rule in favor of Donald Trump. It fundamentally altered the American presidency, transforming it from an office constrained by law into one that can wield official power to commit crimes without consequence.

For the first time in American history, presidents have been told they are above the law when acting in their official capacity. The Court replaced "no one is above the law" with "the President is now a king above the law."

This isn't a conservative or liberal issue. It's a democracy issue.

The Supreme Court took a wrecking ball to constitutional accountability, and only Court reform can rebuild what they destroyed.

Because when the most powerful person in the world is immune from criminal prosecution for using the powers of their office, democracy itself is in mortal danger.

## Corporations as Super-Citizens

*Citizens United v. FEC* (2010) gets all the attention for allowing unlimited corporate political spending. But it's just one decision in a systematic judicial project to expand corporate power while shrinking worker, consumer, and citizen rights.

**The Corporate Rights Expansion:**
- Unlimited political spending (*Citizens United*)
- Mandatory arbitration agreements (*Epic Systems*)
- Class action restrictions (*AT&T Mobility*)
- Weakened consumer protection (*Concepcion*)
- Limited liability for harm (*Exxon Valdez*)
- Religious freedom for corporations (*Hobby Lobby*)

The Roberts Court has granted corporations constitutional rights that exceed those of actual human beings—while dismantling the regulatory framework that constrains corporate abuse.

This is oligarchy dressed as constitutional interpretation.

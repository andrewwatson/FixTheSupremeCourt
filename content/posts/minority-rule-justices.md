## Democracy's Darkest Irony

Here's a fact that should alarm every American who believes in majority rule: [six of the nine current Supreme Court justices](https://www.npr.com/2023/07/13/1185496055/supreme-court-conservative-majority-thomas-trump-bush) were appointed by Republican presidents who lost the popular vote when they first ran for office—and confirmed by senators representing a minority of the American population.

This isn't democracy. It's minority rule with a lifetime appointment.

For the first time in American history, [the Supreme Court's conservative supermajority is a product of minoritarian institutions](https://www.democracynow.org/2024/4/26/ari_berman)—the Electoral College and Senate malapportionment—that give disproportionate power to political minorities.

The result: a Court that overturns *Roe v. Wade* despite 60%+ public support for abortion rights. A Court that grants presidential immunity despite overwhelming opposition. A Court that dismantles gun safety laws despite mass shootings. A Court that serves the preferences of the minority while claiming constitutional authority.

## The Six Justices

**Appointed by George W. Bush (lost popular vote in 2000):**
- Chief Justice John Roberts (2005)
- Justice Samuel Alito (2006)

**Appointed by Donald Trump (lost popular vote in 2016 by 2.9 million):**
- Justice Neil Gorsuch (2017) - Confirmed by senators representing [47% of the population](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/02/minoritarian-third-supreme-court/)
- Justice Brett Kavanaugh (2018) - Confirmed by senators representing [44% of the population](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/02/minoritarian-third-supreme-court/)
- Justice Amy Coney Barrett (2020) - Confirmed by senators representing [48% of the population](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/02/minoritarian-third-supreme-court/)

**Also in the conservative bloc:**
- Justice Clarence Thomas (1991)

Six justices. All appointed through minoritarian institutions. All serving for life. All making decisions opposed by the majority.

This is how democracy dies.

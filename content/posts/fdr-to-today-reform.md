## Court Reform Across Generations

Supreme Court reform isn't a new idea invented by frustrated progressives. It's a recurring response to judicial overreach that spans American history.

**1937**: FDR's court-packing plan threatened to add up to six justices to break conservative obstruction of New Deal programs. The plan failed legislatively but succeeded politically—the Court reversed course.

**1960s-70s**: Conservative frustration with Warren Court civil rights decisions led to calls for impeachment, jurisdiction stripping, and constitutional amendments.

**2020s**: Progressive proposals for term limits, court expansion, ethics codes, and jurisdiction stripping respond to the Federalist Society's capture of the Court.

The difference today: the current Court is more extreme, more partisan, more corrupt, and more captured by special interests than any Court in modern history.

Reform proposals that were once theoretical are now urgent necessities. The choice is reform or democratic collapse.

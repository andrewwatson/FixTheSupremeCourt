The Supreme Court's continued delay in ruling on the legality of President Trump's tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) isn't just about trade policy—it's a troubling sign of how willing this Court may be to hand unchecked power to the executive branch.

## The Case That Should Be Simple

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments on November 5, 2025, in *V.O.S. Selections v. Trump* and a companion case. The legal question is straightforward: Did Congress authorize the President to impose tariffs under IEEPA, a law designed for national security emergencies?

Both the Court of International Trade and the Federal Circuit have already answered: No, IEEPA does not authorize tariff imposition. The text of the statute doesn't grant that power, and Congress has explicit constitutional authority over tariffs—a core legislative function that can't be casually delegated to the President.

Yet here we are, nearly three months after oral arguments, with no ruling.

## The Delay Speaks Volumes

The Court has twice declined to issue the ruling during scheduled decision days. The earliest possible date for an opinion is now February 20, following the Court's monthlong recess. This isn't normal processing time—this is a Court struggling with a decision that legal scholars say should be obvious.

At oral arguments, the justices appeared skeptical of the White House's arguments. But the delay has sparked speculation that the Court may now be leaning toward the Trump Administration. As one legal analyst noted, "the longer the Supreme Court delays its tariff decision, the better it is for President Trump."

## What's Really at Stake

This isn't just about trade. The constitutional questions at the heart of this case reflect a deeper tension:

1. **Can Congress delegate tariff authority to the President?** The Constitution explicitly grants Congress the power to regulate commerce and levy taxes. Allowing the President to unilaterally impose tariffs would fundamentally shift this balance of power.

2. **Did Congress actually do so in IEEPA?** The statute's language doesn't clearly authorize tariffs, yet the Court may be searching for ways to read that authority into the text.

The economic implications are staggering. If the Court overturns the IEEPA tariffs, households would save an average of $1,200 in 2026, with total tax reductions of $1.4 trillion over ten years. IEEPA tariffs since April alone total an estimated $130 billion.

Prediction markets currently give only a 28% probability that the Court will uphold the tariffs as implemented. Yet the delay continues.

## A Pattern of Deference to Executive Power

This case fits a troubling pattern. The same Court that:

- Granted Trump sweeping presidential immunity for "official acts"
- Used the shadow docket to grant emergency relief to the Trump administration at an 83% rate
- Weakened congressional oversight through narrow interpretations of subpoena power
- Dismantled administrative agencies' ability to check executive authority

...is now taking an unusually long time to answer what should be a simple question about whether a president can unilaterally levy taxes on American consumers.

## The Waiting Game Benefits Trump

Every day without a ruling is a day that:

- The tariffs remain in effect, generating revenue for the administration
- Companies can't plan for potential refunds totaling billions of dollars
- Trump can threaten new tariffs (like those proposed for Greenland) without clear legal constraints
- The constitutional principle that Congress controls taxation remains in limbo

The Court of International Trade has stayed all IEEPA refund cases until the Supreme Court rules. Customs officials have been given new deadlines. The entire import/export industry is frozen in uncertainty.

## Why This Matters for Supreme Court Reform

This delay exemplifies why Supreme Court reform is urgent. When a Court packed with ideologically aligned justices struggles to check executive overreach—or worse, appears to be searching for ways to justify it—the entire system of checks and balances breaks down.

The Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse for a reason. If the Supreme Court allows a President to bypass that fundamental protection, we're not just talking about tariffs. We're talking about the end of legislative authority over one of its most essential functions.

The longer this Court takes to rule, the clearer it becomes: They're not struggling with the law. They're struggling with whether to follow it.

# Quick Start: Instagram Marketing for FixTheSupremeCourt.com

## 🚀 Get Started in 30 Minutes

### Step 1: Set Up Instagram (5 minutes)

1. **Create Instagram account**
   - Username suggestion: @FixTheSCOTUS or @ReformTheCourt
   - Profile photo: Create a simple icon (scales of justice, gavel, or SCOTUS building)

2. **Write your bio** (150 characters max):
   ```
   Exposing Supreme Court corruption 📊
   Demanding accountability ⚖️
   Facts, not propaganda.
   👇 Read our latest investigation
   ```

3. **Set up link aggregator**
   - Option 1: Linktree (free) - linktree.com
   - Option 2: Beacons (free) - beacons.ai
   - Option 3: Later's Link in Bio (if using Later for scheduling)

### Step 2: Generate Your First Thumbnails (5 minutes)

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Generate thumbnails for your best posts
python generate_thumbnails.py --post pattern-of-corruption
python generate_thumbnails.py --post federalist-society-court
python generate_thumbnails.py --post thomas-corruption
python generate_thumbnails.py --post voting-rights-destruction
python generate_thumbnails.py --post dhs-social-media-racism

# Or generate all at once:
python generate_thumbnails.py --all
```

Your thumbnails are now in `static/thumbnails/` ready to upload!

### Step 3: Create Your First Post (10 minutes)

**Choose your strongest post:** I recommend starting with "Pattern of Corruption" (Thomas $4.75M gifts)

**Instagram Caption Template:**

```
Justice Clarence Thomas accepted $4.75 MILLION in undisclosed gifts.

Justice Samuel Alito took a $100,000 luxury fishing trip from a billionaire, then ruled in his favor.

Both refused to recuse. Both investigated themselves. Both found no wrongdoing.

This is corruption. And the Supreme Court has zero enforceable ethics rules to stop it.

Every other judge in America faces binding ethics codes. Why not the Supreme Court?

```

**Steps:**
1. Upload image: `static/thumbnails/pattern-of-corruption.png`
2. Paste caption
3. Add location (optional): "Washington, DC"
4. Post!

### Step 4: Create Story Highlights (5 minutes)

Create 4-5 permanent Story Highlight categories:

1. **🔥 Latest** - Most recent posts
2. **💰 Corruption** - Thomas/Alito scandals
3. **⚖️ Bad Decisions** - Immunity, Chevron, voting rights
4. **🌍 Solutions** - Reform proposals
5. **📚 Learn** - Explainers and FAQs

### Step 5: Schedule Your First Week (5 minutes)

**Recommended posting schedule:**

**Day 1 (Today):** Pattern of Corruption (Thomas gifts)
**Day 2:** Federalist Society Court (dark money)
**Day 3:** Voting Rights Destruction (Shelby County)
**Day 4:** DHS Social Media Racism (connects to Court failures)

## 💡 Pro Tips for Maximum Impact

### Writing Instagram Captions

**Formula:**
1. **Hook** (first line) - Shocking fact or question
2. **Context** (2-3 sentences) - Why it matters
3. **Proof** (2-3 sentences) - Evidence/details
4. **Call to action** - "Link in bio," "Share if you agree," etc.
5. **Hashtags** - 9-12 relevant tags

**Example Hook Lines:**
- "Justice Thomas accepted $4.75 MILLION in gifts."
- "Six justices appointed by presidents who LOST the popular vote."
- "The Supreme Court just granted presidents immunity for crimes."
- "2013: Voting Rights Act gutted. 2025: 94 restrictive voting laws passed."

### Best Times to Post

Research shows best engagement on Instagram:
- **Weekdays**: 11am - 2pm EST (lunch break scrolling)
- **Evenings**: 7pm - 9pm EST (after work/dinner)
- **Best days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

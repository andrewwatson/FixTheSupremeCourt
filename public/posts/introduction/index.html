<p>The United States Supreme Court is supposed to be above politics. It&rsquo;s supposed to represent the rule of law, not the rule of party. But here&rsquo;s a fact that should make every American&rsquo;s blood boil: six of the nine current justices were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, and three were confirmed by senators representing less than half the American population.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t your parents&rsquo; Supreme Court. This is a partisan institution that has been systematically captured through decades of political maneuvering, outright hypocrisy, and constitutional hardball. The result? A Court that doesn&rsquo;t represent America is now making decisions that will govern America for generations.</p>
<h2 id="the-mcconnell-power-grab-hypocrisy-in-real-time">The McConnell Power Grab: Hypocrisy in Real Time<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-mcconnell-power-grab-hypocrisy-in-real-time">#</a></h2>
<p>The theft of the Supreme Court didn&rsquo;t happen overnight. It was a carefully orchestrated heist, and Mitch McConnell was the mastermind.</p>
<p>In February 2016, when Justice Antonin Scalia died, President Obama had nearly a year left in his term. Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a moderate judge who Republicans had previously praised. McConnell&rsquo;s response? He invented a new rule: no Supreme Court confirmations in election years. &ldquo;The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice,&rdquo; McConnell declared, blocking even hearings for Garland.</p>
<p>Fast forward to September 2020. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died just 46 days before the presidential election. Did McConnell stick to his principled &ldquo;election year&rdquo; rule? Of course not. Within hours of Ginsburg&rsquo;s death, he announced the Senate would vote on Trump&rsquo;s nominee. Amy Coney Barrett was confirmed just eight days before the election.</p>
<p>The same senators who solemnly proclaimed in 2016 that &ldquo;the people should decide&rdquo; rushed through Barrett&rsquo;s confirmation while millions of Americans were already voting. Senator Lindsey Graham, who had said in 2016, &ldquo;I want you to use my words against me,&rdquo; was suddenly singing a different tune when it served his political purposes.</p>
<p>This wasn&rsquo;t governance. It was a power grab, pure and simple.</p>
<h2 id="the-federalist-society-assembly-line">The Federalist Society Assembly Line<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-federalist-society-assembly-line">#</a></h2>
<p>The Court&rsquo;s current composition isn&rsquo;t an accident—it&rsquo;s the culmination of a 40-year project by the Federalist Society and its allies to capture America&rsquo;s courts.</p>
<p>Since the 1980s, conservative legal activists led by figures like Leonard Leo have built an assembly line for right-wing judges. They identify promising law students, groom them through internships and clerkships, fund their careers, and ultimately deliver them to the Court. Five of the six conservative justices are Federalist Society members, and the sixth, Clarence Thomas, is closely aligned with their ideology.</p>
<p>This isn&rsquo;t how judicial selection is supposed to work. These justices weren&rsquo;t chosen for their legal brilliance or judicial temperament—they were selected specifically to deliver predetermined conservative outcomes. The Federalist Society didn&rsquo;t invest millions of dollars in this project out of abstract legal philosophy. They wanted results, and they got them.</p>
<p>Dark money has flooded this process, with Leonard Leo&rsquo;s network alone directing over $400 million to influence judicial selection and confirmation battles. We&rsquo;re not getting the best legal minds; we&rsquo;re getting ideological warriors funded by anonymous donors.</p>
<h2 id="the-abortion-rights-long-game-decades-of-deception">The Abortion Rights Long Game: Decades of Deception<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-abortion-rights-long-game-decades-of-deception">#</a></h2>
<p>The overturning of Roe v. Wade wasn&rsquo;t a surprise legal development—it was the predetermined outcome of a decades-long campaign.</p>
<p>The three Trump appointees—Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett—all assured senators during their confirmation hearings that Roe was &ldquo;settled law&rdquo; and established precedent. Barrett called it &ldquo;precedent of precedent.&rdquo; Kavanaugh said he would follow precedent &ldquo;going forward.&rdquo; Gorsuch emphasized the importance of stare decisis.</p>
<p>They were lying.</p>
<p>Within two years of Barrett&rsquo;s confirmation, these same justices voted to overturn Roe, dismissing 50 years of precedent and the reliance interests of millions of women. The legal reasoning didn&rsquo;t change—the composition of the Court did.</p>
<p>This was always the plan. Conservative legal groups spent decades crafting the perfect test case, forum-shopping for sympathetic judges, and building the legal infrastructure to challenge reproductive rights. The moment they had five votes, precedent became meaningless.</p>
<p>If Supreme Court nominees can lie under oath about their intentions and face zero consequences, what does that say about the integrity of the confirmation process?</p>
<h2 id="court-expansion-actually-normal-in-american-history">Court Expansion: Actually Normal in American History<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#court-expansion-actually-normal-in-american-history">#</a></h2>
<p>Whenever reform is discussed, critics cry that changing the Court would be &ldquo;radical&rdquo; or &ldquo;unprecedented.&rdquo; This is historically illiterate nonsense.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court&rsquo;s size has changed seven times in the nation&rsquo;s first 80 years. The Judiciary Act of 1789 created a six-member Court. It grew to seven members in 1807, nine in 1837, ten in 1863, back to seven in 1866, and finally to nine in 1869. For most of American history, the Court&rsquo;s size tracked with the number of federal circuit courts.</p>
<p>The most famous expansion effort came in 1937, when Franklin Roosevelt threatened to add justices to overcome the Court&rsquo;s resistance to New Deal programs. FDR never got his expansion, but the threat worked—the Court suddenly started upholding his legislation in what became known as &ldquo;the switch in time that saved nine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea that nine is somehow sacred is a modern myth. What&rsquo;s actually radical is allowing a minority-appointed Court to govern against the will of the majority indefinitely.</p>
<p>Other democracies regularly reform their high courts. Germany restructured its Constitutional Court after World War II. The United Kingdom replaced the House of Lords&rsquo; judicial function with a new Supreme Court in 2009. Canada&rsquo;s Supreme Court operates with mandatory retirement ages. The idea that America&rsquo;s system is perfect and unchangeable is American exceptionalism at its worst.</p>
<h2 id="the-legitimacy-crisis-a-court-out-of-step-with-america">The Legitimacy Crisis: A Court Out of Step with America<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-legitimacy-crisis-a-court-out-of-step-with-america">#</a></h2>
<p>Public trust in the Supreme Court has collapsed, and for good reason. Gallup polling shows confidence in the Court at historic lows, with approval dropping to just 40% in recent years—lower than Congress.</p>
<p>The Court&rsquo;s decisions increasingly split along purely ideological lines, with the six conservative justices voting as a bloc on the most contentious issues. This isn&rsquo;t judicial reasoning—it&rsquo;s partisan politics in robes.</p>
<p>Consider the mathematical absurdity: justices appointed by presidents who received fewer votes than their opponents, confirmed by senators representing a minority of Americans, are now making decisions that affect every aspect of American life. They&rsquo;re overturning gun regulations supported by 80% of Americans, restricting voting rights in ways opposed by majorities, and eliminating reproductive freedoms that most Americans want to protect.</p>
<p>This is minority rule with a lifetime appointment.</p>
<p>The Court has also become increasingly imperial in its behavior. The shadow docket—unsigned, unexplained emergency orders—has exploded under the current Court, allowing them to make major policy changes without oral argument or full briefing. They&rsquo;re not just interpreting law; they&rsquo;re making it, often in the dead of night without accountability.</p>
<h2 id="the-path-forward-reform-or-irrelevance">The Path Forward: Reform or Irrelevance<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-path-forward-reform-or-irrelevance">#</a></h2>
<p>The status quo is unsustainable. A Supreme Court that operates without accountability, represents a minority of Americans, and makes decisions based on partisan politics rather than legal principle cannot maintain legitimacy in a democracy.</p>
<p>Reform isn&rsquo;t radical—it&rsquo;s essential. Whether that means expanding the Court, implementing term limits, establishing binding ethics rules, or requiring supermajority votes to overturn precedent, something must change.</p>
<p>The alternative is a democracy where unelected, unaccountable lifetime appointees can override the will of the people indefinitely. That&rsquo;s not the American system our founders envisioned, and it&rsquo;s not the system we should accept.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court belongs to the American people, not to the Federalist Society, not to dark money donors, and not to the political party that happened to be in power when vacancies occurred. It&rsquo;s time to fix the Court before the Court breaks our democracy entirely.</p>
<p>The choice is clear: reform the Court, or watch it continue to undermine the very democratic principles it&rsquo;s supposed to protect. The American people deserve better than a stolen Court making decisions that will govern our lives for decades to come.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to fix the Supreme Court.</p>

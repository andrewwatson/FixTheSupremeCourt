## Overview

This document outlines a multi-platform strategy to drive traffic to FixTheSupremeCourt.com, with initial focus on Instagram as the primary growth channel.

---

## Instagram Strategy

### Why Instagram?

- **Visual platform** - Supreme Court content can be presented as compelling graphics
- **Shareability** - Controversial/important topics get shared widely
- **Younger demographics** - Reach audiences who need civic education
- **Story format** - Break complex topics into digestible slides
- **Engagement** - Comments and shares drive algorithmic visibility

### Content Types

#### 1. Quote Graphics (Post Titles as Images)

**Format:**
- Bold, readable typography
- High contrast (white text on dark background, or vice versa)
- Post title as main text
- Site URL/handle at bottom
- Dimensions: 1080x1080px (square) or 1080x1350px (portrait)

**Example Titles to Convert:**
- "Justice Thomas Accepted $4.75 Million in Undisclosed Gifts"
- "Six Justices Appointed by Presidents Who Lost the Popular Vote"
- "How the Supreme Court Systematically Dismantled Voting Rights"
- "The Federalist Society Supreme Court: How Dark Money Bought the Judiciary"

**Color Schemes:**
- Dark blue/navy background with white text (authoritative, serious)
- Red background with white text (urgent, alarming)
- Black background with gold/yellow text (luxury corruption theme)
- White background with dark text (clean, professional)

#### 2. Infographics

**Topics:**
- Timeline of Thomas corruption ($4.75M visualization)
- Map of states that passed voting restrictions after Shelby County
- Comparison: US lifetime tenure vs. international term limits
- Federalist Society pipeline (6 of 9 justices)
- Presidential immunity decision breakdown

**Format:**
- Multi-slide carousels (up to 10 slides)
- Each slide focuses on one data point
- Final slide: "Read more at FixTheSupremeCourt.com"

#### 3. "Did You Know?" Series

Short, shocking facts that drive engagement:
- "Did you know the Supreme Court is the ONLY court in America without enforceable ethics rules?"
- "Did you know Justice Alito flew insurrection flags at his homes?"
- "Did you know 6 justices were appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote?"
- "Did you know Germany limits constitutional court judges to 12-year terms?"

#### 4. Carousel Explainers

Break down complex posts into 5-10 slide carousels:
- Slide 1: Provocative title/question
- Slides 2-8: Key facts, one per slide
- Slide 9: What can be done
- Slide 10: Link to full article

**Example: "How Presidential Immunity Works"**
1. "The Supreme Court Just Made Presidents Kings"
2. "What Trump v. United States Actually Says"
3. "Official Acts = Immunity"
4. "Personal Acts = Maybe Prosecutable"
5. "But Who Decides What's Official?"
6. "The President Does (Circular Logic)"
7. "Historical Precedent: Zero"
8. "What This Means for Democracy"
9. "What We Can Do About It"
10. "Read the full analysis → FixTheSupremeCourt.com"

#### 5. Video/Reels (Future Phase)

- Narrated versions of blog posts
- "60 seconds on Supreme Court corruption"
- Before/after comparisons (voting rights, gun laws, etc.)

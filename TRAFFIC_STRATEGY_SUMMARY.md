## 📈 Measuring Success

### Track Weekly (Use Instagram Insights)

1. **Follower growth** - Aim for 10-15% growth/week initially
2. **Engagement rate** - Target 10%+ (likes + comments ÷ followers)
3. **Post reach** - How many people saw your content
4. **Profile visits** - Are people checking your bio?
5. **Website clicks** - Use link tracker to measure traffic

### Track Monthly (Use Google Analytics)

1. **Referral traffic from Instagram** - Sessions from Instagram
2. **Time on site** - Are visitors reading full articles?
3. **Pages per session** - Do they explore multiple posts?
4. **Bounce rate** - Do they leave immediately or engage?

### Adjust Based on Data

**If engagement is low:**
- Test different posting times
- Try different caption styles
- Ask questions to spark discussion

**If clicks are low:**
- Stronger calls-to-action
- Make link in bio more prominent
- Tease content better in captions

**If growth stalls:**
- Increase engagement with others
- Try paid promotion ($5-10 test)
- Create more shareable content (infographics)

---

## 🎨 Design Best Practices

### For Quote Graphics (Python Script)

**Good titles to convert:**
- Short, punchy statements
- Shocking statistics
- Questions that make you think
- Calls to action

**Examples:**
✅ "Justice Thomas Accepted $4.75 Million in Gifts"
✅ "Six Justices from Presidents Who Lost the Popular Vote"
✅ "How the Supreme Court Systematically Dismantled Voting Rights"

**Less effective:**
❌ Very long titles (will be tiny text)
❌ Titles needing lots of context
❌ Overly academic phrasing

### For Canva Graphics

**Best use cases:**
- Infographics with data/charts
- Before/after comparisons
- Multi-slide carousels
- Photo-based posts

**Design tips:**
- High contrast (dark bg + light text or vice versa)
- One main point per slide
- Minimal text (Instagram is mobile)
- Brand colors consistent

---

## ⚠️ Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Posting without engaging** - Social media is social! Interact.
2. **Inconsistent schedule** - Pick a frequency you can maintain
3. **Ignoring analytics** - Data tells you what works
4. **Too much self-promotion** - 80% value, 20% promotion
5. **No call-to-action** - Tell people what to do next
6. **Giving up too soon** - Growth takes 3-6 months

---
